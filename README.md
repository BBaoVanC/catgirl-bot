# catgirl
A discord bot

Code is bad, that is to be expected. I will eventually fix it. This is my first day of python in 4 years, and my first time ever using python 3

## Features
- Commands:
    - warn
    - kick
    - ban
    - purge
    - filter bypass role setup
    - filter add/remove for blacklisted words
    - userinfo/info/user command
    - avatar/pfp command
    - botinvite/link command (gets the bot invite link)

## To use:
1. Install python 3.9
2. Create a file called .env in this folder
3. Get the token of the discord bot (please google if you don't already know how to get this)
4. Add DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token
5. Add CLIENT_ID=your_client_id (or the botinvite command will not work properly)
4. Go to this directory and run `python catgirl.py`
