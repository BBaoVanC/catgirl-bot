A random bot I made in 2 seconds for my server because I was bored

Code is bad, that is to be expected. I will eventually fix it. This is my first day of python in 4 years, and my first time ever using python 3

## Features
- Commands:
    - warn
    - kick
    - ban
    - purge
    - filter bypass role setup
    - filter add/remove for blacklisted words

## To use:
1. Install python 3.9
2. Create a file called .env in this folder
3. Get the token of the discord bot (please google if you don't already know how to get this)
4. Add DISCORD_TOKEN= your token
4. Go to this directory and run python main.py
